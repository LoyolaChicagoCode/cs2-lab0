# Loyola COMP 271 Design Activity 0

## Group project

Implement your solution to the recurring rainfall problem as a working Java program.

# Functional requirements

Your program should behave as discussed in class. Input items (whole and/or floating point numbers) can be spread over one or more lines. If there is at least one input item, the program prints the resulting average and exits. If there is no valid numerical input item, the program prints nothing and exits.

# Reflection

What specific changes do you need to make to enable automatic testing for your code? At least how many test cases should you have, and which ones (a high-level description is sufficient).

# Submission

Add a readme file including your reflection and any other thoughts. In IDEA, export your project as a zip file and submit as directed.

# Grading (total 5)

-    2 submission exists
-    0.5 correct average calculation for one or more inputs
-    0.5 empty output (rather than NaN or error) for empty input
-    0.5 detect EOF (rather than specific sentinel value) following Scanner-based idiom
-    0.5 input can have zero or more double values on each line
-    0.5 good coding style (indentation, use of final everywhere except when a variable has to be updated one or more times)
-    0.5 meaningful reflection (three or more sentences) preferably in readme file
